# Lecture 1:
Reinforcement learning: Learns from experience without a correct label or answer provided. It have interaction with environment.

Supervised learning: Learns from experience while providing the correct label. It don't have interaction with environment.

Unsupervised learning: Learns from experience without providing the correct label. It don't have interaction with environment.

# Lecture 2:
Markov Process: You have a finite or potentially infinite set of states, and you have a dynamics model which specifies the probability for the next state give the privious state with no rewards and actions yet.

Markov Reward Process: Markov chain + reward. No action yet. MRP value = immediate reward + sum of discounted future rewards.

Markov Decision Process: MRP + actions

(example: think of mars rover)
