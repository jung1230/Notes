# Supervised Learning VS Unsupervised Learning
### Conclusion:
- **Supervised learning: the training dataset is labeled with the answer.**
- **Unsupervised Learning: The training dataset isn't labeled with the answer.**

### Supplement:
**Supervised Learning**:
- **Definition**: The training dataset includes labeled data, which means that each training example is paired with an output label. The model learns to map inputs to the correct output based on these labels.
- **Goal**: Predict the correct output labels for new, unseen data.
- **Common Algorithms**: Linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, random forests, neural networks.
- **Examples**:
    - **Classification**: Email spam detection (spam or not spam), image recognition (cat, dog, or other).
    - **Regression**: Predicting house prices, forecasting stock prices.

**Unsupervised Learning**:
- **Definition**: The training dataset is not labeled. The model tries to identify patterns and structures in the data without explicit instructions on what to look for.
- **Goal**: Discover the underlying structure of the data, such as grouping similar items or reducing data dimensionality.
- **Common Algorithms**: K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), autoencoders.
- **Examples**:
    - **Clustering**: Customer segmentation in marketing, grouping similar documents.
    - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features in a dataset while preserving important information.

# Easy steps to follow for ML
1. Observe the data. Charts are a good tool for observing the data.
2. Do feature engineering. Feature engineering involves preparing data for machine learning models through processes such as data cleaning, encoding categorical variables into numerical formats, and standardizing numerical data.
3. Create model.
